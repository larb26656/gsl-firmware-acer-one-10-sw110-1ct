1. Install git if not yet installed and download the firmware / tools

sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/onitake/gsl-firmware.git
2. Extract firmware for your original windows file (you can use my in attachment to see if it works) and copy firmware to correct folder

copy the SileadTouch.fw to gsl-firmware/tools and run

unscramble SileadTouch.fw firmware.fw
./fwtool -c firmware.fw -m 1680 -w 1920 -h 1080 -t 2 silead_ts.fw
sudo cp silead_ts.fw /lib/firmware/
3. compile and install driver

go back to the folder where you cloned the firmware/tools and

git clone https://github.com/onitake/gslx680-acpi.git
cd gslx680-acpi
make
sudo cp gslx680_ts_acpi.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/
4. Testing

at this point you can test the touchscreen.
In the same folder as the step above just do:

sudo insmod ./gslx680_ts_acpi.ko

You should now have a working and not calibrated touch screen

5. Calibrating touch

It’s good to have a tool for that.
Just install xinput_calibrator:

sudo apt-get install xinput_calibrator
xinput_calibrator
and touch the screen on the points.

It will output a configuration text that you should put on a file (or use mine in attachment)

6. Make everything permanent:

sudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf

and paste your config output, or mine:

Section "InputClass"
Identifier "calibration"
MatchProduct "Silead GSLx680 Touchscreen"
Option "Calibration" "5 1958 26 1545"
Option "SwapAxes" "0"
EndSection
As we’ve already copied the driver to /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/ now we just need to tell the system to load it on boot:

sudo echo 'gslx680_ts_acpi' | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
sudo depmod
7. Reboot and you’re done.
